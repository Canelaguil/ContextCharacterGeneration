## Community building blocks
### Factions
Factions are affiliations that people belong to. People can only belong to one faction at a time. There is a negative modifier for relationships between factions, and a positive modifier for inter-faction relationships. There is a customizable mobility between factions.

Factions can be used as: 
- religious factions
- medieval guildes
- political leanings
-
### Classes
Class is the income class of the characters. Class determines the places people can live, the jobs they can access and the people they interact with. There is customizable mobility between factions.


## Institutions
### Orphanage
An orphanage is a place where children younger than 18 go to live if there are no guardians left in their household and no other familly is found

### Monastery
A monastery is a place where adults older than 16 can go to live, sometimes linked to a faction they belong to.
